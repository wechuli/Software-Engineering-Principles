## Concepts from Computer Science to Master

1. **Algorithms and Data Structures** - From big O notation to basic data structures - Stack, Queues, Graphs, Trees - the fundamental constructs of programming to write robust, scalable and efficient algorithm. Computer science major also finds these concepts hard to understand.

2. **Operating System Programming** - This might not be trivial for entry level programmers, but working on the scale applications pushes the complexities on the realm of the operating system - kernel space and user space, library calls and system calls, semaphores and mutex. Now, it’s time to tune the kernel level parameters to scale the application.

3. **System Programming and Compilers Design** - Although very few end up with designing compilers or interpreters, it gives the concept of semantics of language, byte codes and binaries. Why do you write a code in C, not in Java or vice versa?

4. **Computer Networks** - Although TCP/IP protocol looks trivial, but understanding TCP/IP stacks from OS and network perspective, optimizing kernel parameters for TCP flow, understanding sockets on OS requires a good understanding of each layer of the TCP/IP protocol to write and scale distributed applications.

5. **Programming Language Concepts** - This course will give idea why you want to use a compiler instead of interpreter or assembler and how the programming language itself are designed i.e. semantics of programming language - why do you want to write in Go instead of Ruby?

6. **Object Oriented Programming** - how to use polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance in the class. How do you make UML diagrams?

7. **Software Engineering** - From requirement engineering to waterfall models, agility of the software development processes is important.

8. **Database Design and Applications** - DML, DDL, index optimization, etc. plays critical role in application design and optimization

9. **Discrete Mathematics** - how tuples and Cartesian products formalize the concept in RDBMS, functions, graph theory, vertex, Venn diagrams - the fundamentals of computer science and the math that distinguish CS from solid engineering.

10. **Distributed Computing** - When working in the scale applications, the tools and concepts required for massively parallel programming computing - multiprocessing and multi-threading. The trade-off of multi-threading and multiprocessing, MPI or Java threads, and concurrency control. Why do you need MPI programming ? process parallelization versus threads parallelization.

11. **System Architecture**- As a programmer, many will work on the small piece of product line. However, it’s very important to understand end-to-end architecture of the system which requires knowledge in (application, OS, network, and virtualization) end to end engineering.

12. **Digital Logics and Computer Architecture**: Concept of binary, hexadecimal, octet, logic gates, sub-nets, flip-flops, cores, multi-core, hypethreading , bus, etc. These concepts looks trivial, yet reasonably complex. how to calculate subnets and the concept of MAC address.

13. **Documentation** - Because of lack of vocabulary and jargon, the difficulty to write technical articles and documentation or designing UML case diagrams for OOAD. Unfortunately, many computer science majors lack technical writing and communication skills.
