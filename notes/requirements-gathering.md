# Requirement Gathering

- Why requirements are important
- The characteristics of good requirements
- The MOSCOW method for prioritizing requirements
- Audience-oriented, FURPS and FURPS+ method for categorizing requirements
- Methods for gathering customer goals and turing them into requirements
- Brainstorming techniques
- Methods for recording requirements such as formal specifications, user stories, and prototypes

Requirements are the features that your application must provide. At the beginning of the project, you gather requirements from the customers to figure out what you need to build. Throughout development, you use the requirements to guide development and ensure that you're heading in the right direction. At the end of the project, you use the requirements to verify that the finished application actually does what it's supposed to do.

## Properties of Useful requirements

### Clear
Good requirements are clear, concise and easy to understand. To be clear, requirements cannot be vague or ill-defined. Each requirement must state in concrete, no-nonsense terms exactly what it requires.

### Unambigous
In addition to being clear and concrete, a requirement must be unambigous. If the requirement is worded so that you can't tell what it requires, then you can't build a system to satisfy it. As you write requirements, do your best to make them unambigous. Read them carefully to make sure you can't think of any way to interpret them other than the way you intend.

### Consistent
A project's requirements must be consistent with each other. That means not only that they cannot contradict each other, but they also don't provide so many constraints that the problem is unsolvable. Each requirement must also be self-consistent. In a complex project, it's not always obvous if a set of requirements is mutually consistent. Sometimes any pair of requirements is satisfiable but larger combinations of requirements are not
A common software engineering expression is "Fast,good,cheap.Pick two"
Try to kepp new requirements consisten with existing requirements.

### Prioritized
When you start working on the project's schedule, it's likely you'll need to cut a few nice-to-haves from the design. You might like to include every feature but don't have the time or budget, so something's got to go. At this point, you need to prioritize the requirements.
