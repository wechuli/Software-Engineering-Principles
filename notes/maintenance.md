# Maintenance

Maintenance may not always be a lot of fun, but it's important because maintenance is often relatively expensive. Often maintenance accounts for 75 percent of a project's total cost

To safely modify old code, you need to spend time studying it. If you don't dig into the code and make sure you understand how it works, you're just as likely to add bugs to the code as remove them. After you make your changes, you need to test them to verigy that they work. You also need to thoroughly test the rest of the application to make sure your changes didn't break anything.

You can reduce maintanance costs by doing a good jon when you write the initial code. For example, develop simple but flexible designs, use good programming practices, insert comments to make the code easy to read and provide documentation for future generations of maintenance programmers can figure out what you were thinking when you wrote the code.
