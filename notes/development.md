# Development

    "A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street"
                                                            - Doug Linder


    "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live"
                                                            -Martin Golding

Testing often begins before development is completely finished. In fact, it's best to test software early and often. It's widely known that bugs are easiest to find and fix if they're detected soon after they're created, so if possible you should test every method you write as soon as it's finished(sometimes even before it's finished)

## Use The Right Tools

### Hardware

Few things are as frustruting as trying to write software on inadequate hardware. Programmers need fast computers with lots of memory and disk space. A programmer with an underpowered computer or insufficiant memory takes longer to do everything.

### Network

### Development Environment

### Source Code Control

A good source code management system enables you to go back through past versions of the software and see exactly what changes were made and when.

### Profilers

Profilers let you determine what parts of the program use the most time, memory, files or other resources. They can save you a huge amount of time when you are trying to tune an application's performance.

### Static Analysis Tools

Profilers monitor a program as it executes to see how it works. Static analysis tools study code without executing it. They tend to focus on the code's style.

### Testing Tools

Testing tools, particularly automated tools, can make testing a whole lot faster and more reliable.

### Source Code Formatters

Some development environments do a better job of formatting code than others. That formatting makes code easier to read and understand. That in turn reduces the number of bugs in the code and makes finding and fxing bugs easier.

### Refactoring Tools

The term refactoring is programmer-speak for "rearranging code to make it easier to understand, more maintainable, or generally better". Some refactoring tools let you do things like easily define new classes or methods or extract a chunk of code into a new method. Refactoring tools can be particularly useful if you're managing existing code(as opposed to writing new code)

### Training

Training makes programmers more effective and keeps them happy.

## Selecting Algorithms

After low-level design is mostly complete, you should have a good sense of what classes you need and the task those classes need to perform. The next step is writing the code to perform those tasks.

For more complicated problems, the first step is researching possible algorithms. An algorithm is like a recipe for solving a hard programming problem e,g
- Sorting and arranging pieces of data
- Quickly locating items in databases
- Finding optimal paths through street, power, communication or other networks
- Designing networks to provide necessary capacity and redundancy to prevent single points of failure
- Encrypting and decrypting data
- Picking optimal investment strategies
- Findning least cost construction and production strategies

Fortunately, these sorts of algorithms have been extensively studied for years, so you usually don't need to write your own from scratch. You can use the internet and algorithm books to look for an approach that fits your problem.

You'll probably still need to do some work plugging the algorithm into your application, but there's no need for you to reinvent everything from scratch. However, even if you don't need to build an algorithm from the ground up, you should know some of the characteristics that make an algorithm a good choice for you.
The following describe some of the charcteristics:
