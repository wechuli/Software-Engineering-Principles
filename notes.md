# Software Engineering

A formal definition of software engineering might be 'An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software"

More intiutively, software engineering is everything you need to do to produce successful software.

## Why is Software Engineering Important

- Without it programmers may not understand what users want or need, so they build the wrong application
- The program might be so full of bugs that it's frustrating to use, impossible to fix, and can't be enhanced over time
- The program could be completely effective but confusing to understand

Software engineering includes techniques for avoiding the many pitfalls that otherwise might send your project down the road to failure.It ensures the final application is effective, usable and maintainable.

## Before the Beginning

Before you start working on a software project, even before you dig into the details of what the project is about, there are preparations you should make.

### Document Management
A software engineering project uses a lot of documents. During development, it's important to check the documentation to see what you're supposed to be doing.You need to easily find the most recent version of the requirements to see what the application should do.Similarly, you need to find the most recent high-level and low-level designs to see if you're following the plan correctly.

Document history is important. Unless you have a good document history, you may never know why and when the requirement was changed, so you won't know whether it's okay to change it again.You need a document control system that prevents two people from making changes to the same document at the same time.

Every design decision, requirements change, and memo should be tucked away for later use.

You should separate tools to manage source code and other kinds of documents.

### Code Documentation

The single most important requirement for a program's code is that it be understandable to the people who write and maintain it.Without good documentation, including both design documetns and comments inside the code, modifying or fixing your code later may be a nightmare.

- Code documentation should include high- and low-level design documents that you store in the document repository with other kinds of documentation. These provide an overview of the methods the code is using to do whatever its supposed to do.
- Code documentation should also include comments in the code to help you understand what the code is actually doing and how it works

### Application Documentation
At some point, you also need to prepare documentation that describes the application. Depending on the eventual number and kinds of users, you may need to write user manuals(for end users, managers, database admins and more),quick start guides, cheat sheets, user interface maps, training materials and marketing materials.Although creating this material is just another task, don't start too late in the project schedule.

## Summary
Documentation is produced throughout a project's lifespan, starting with early discussions of the project's requirements, extending through design and programming, continuing into training materials and lasting even beyond the project's release in the form of comments, bug reports and change requests.To get the most out of your documentation, you need to set up a document tracking system before you start the project. Then you can effectively use the project documents to determine what you need to do and how you should do it. You can also figure out what wa decided in the past so that you don't need to constantly rehash old decisions.

Document control is one of the first tools you should set up when you're considerinf a new project. You can use it to archive ideas before you know what the projecct will be about or whether there will even be a project. Once you know the project will happen, you should start tracking the project with project management tools
