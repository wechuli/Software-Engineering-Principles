# Softwre Engineering

A formal definition of software engineering might be 'An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use and maintenance of software"

More intiutively, software engineering is everything you need to do to produce successful software.

## Why is Software Engineering Important

- Without it programmers may not understand what users want or need, so they build the wrong application
- The program might be so full of bugs that it's frustrating to use, impossible to fix, and can't be enhanced over time
- The program could be completely effective but confusing to understand

Software engineering includes techniques for avoiding the many pitfalls that otherwise might send your project down the road to failure.It ensures the final application is effective, usable and maintainable.
