# OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming and visualizing RESTful web services.

## Major Problems with APIs Development

- Maintaining documentation, tests and implementation is hard
- Implementation comes at a cost of user experience
- Communication between services built in different programming languages is not easy

OpenAPI Specification allows:

- Machines/tools to integrate with API
- Allow humans to implement API code
- Allow humans to read and generate API documentation

SwaggerHub is the API design and documentation platform built for teams to drive consistency and discipline across their API development workflow.
